    <h1>Entry One</h1>
    <p>I've been following him for some time now. I've known him for a few years, and something has always seemed off. Gregory, or I guess, GrisStar, as he's known, is a strange one. Perhaps the first time I noticed something off was when I was walking along the path to my home and saw him performing some kind of ritual. I had no idea at the time what he was doing, but all I know was that I saw something fucking horrifying that day that I know now to be an entity by the name of "Henry". From what I know from my time trailing them, Henry helps GrisStar with his music endeavors, and in return GrisStar helps Henry. I'm still not entirely sure how, but I feel I'm on the verge of finding out.</p>
