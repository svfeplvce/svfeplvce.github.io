                    <p>Gregory Alsobrooks, better known as GrisStar, is a musician from Gaylord, Michigan now residing in Anchorage, Alaska. He enjoys creating synth/acoustic hybrid pieces of music, and is attempting to step out of his previous instrumental scene into more traditional forms of song. He is, as of recently, a self-managed musician, and has released his last 2 albums "Mankind" and "The End." to appropriate success according to his small fanbase. He is currently working on two LPs, one of which is slated for a 2023 release.</p>
