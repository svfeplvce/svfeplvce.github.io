                    <h1>Who is GrisStar?</h1>
                    <p>Gregory Alsobrooks, better known as GrisStar, is a musician from Gaylord, Michigan now residing in Anchorage, Alaska. He enjoys creating synth/acoustic hybrid pieces of music, and is attempting to step out of his previous instrumental scene into more traditional forms of song. He is, as of recently, a self-managed musician, and has released his last 2 albums "Mankind" and "The End." to appropriate success according to his small fanbase. He is currently working on two LPs, one of which is slated for a 2023 release.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5SEho9Z6GucQJIDsMVoHl6">Vulture EP</a> was created and distributed in the winter of 2020, shortly before GrisStar met his former manager and colleague, Henry. The album is instrumental and consists of 6 tracks including singles "Woof" and "Vultures".</p>

                        <p><a href="https://share.amuse.io/album/grisstar-mankind">"Mankind"</a> was an album released suddenly in early 2022 while under Henry's management. The secretive production of this album is possibly the cause of Greg and Henry's falling out. The album consists of older songs and singles, Mooshwa, Travel, and Vipie.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://share.amuse.io/album/grisstar-the-end">"The End"</a> was released October 2022 after 6 months of production. It is the first work of GrisStar's to feature vocals, being present in tracks such as "Silence", "IGTG", and the titular "The End." The track "Corvus" was released as a single prior to the album's release. Since the album's release, it has become GrisStar's most popular work. Still not popular enough to pay the bills, though.</p>
